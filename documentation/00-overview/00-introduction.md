# Introduction

Laravel OpenAPI Generator is a Laravel package that inspects your application routes and generates documentation artifacts in three formats:

- OpenAPI 3.0.3 (JSON/YAML)
- Postman Collection v2.1
- Insomnia Workspace v4

The package relies on route inspection, FormRequest validation rules, and model metadata to infer request/response schemas, and it can optionally read documentation templates from your configuration and resource templates.
